I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails within 1 business day.\n  Course Description This is a first-year graduate level course in biostatistical computing. This course is designed to provide an introduction to R programming. We will cover the data management/manipulation, common graphical and statistical procedures both in R. No knowledge of calculus/algebra is required although some vector/matrix operations will be discussed.\n Topics  R/RStudio Vector/matrix operations Probability distributions and random number generation Statistical functions RMarkdown, GitHub Functions, Packages Data management, tidyverse R graphics, data visualization Interactive web apps with Shiny   Prerequisites  No formal course requirements, but basic knowledge of the following will help  Basic linear algebra: vectors, matrices, determinants Simple calculus: derivatives, integrals, gradients Some probability theory: probability, random variables, distributions Basic statistics knowledge: descriptive statistics, estimators. (Linear) modeling  Hardware  A laptop, Mac or Linux OSs are recommended.    Learning Objectives Learn advanced R programming and reproducible research practices\n Understand principles and tools for R data analysis and visualization\n Implement basic types of neural networks using Keras/TensorFlow R interface   About the class This course is a part of 3-credit hour course. The class will be conducted via Zoom and include lecture and coding parts. Classes will not be recorded. Course material will be publicly available. The syllabus is subject to change.\n Course Website: https://bios524-biostatistical-computing-R.netlify.com\n Office Hours: contact the Instructor with questions and on-demand Zoom meeting requests\n   Attendance Attendance is not checked, but students are responsible for all announcements made in class.\nHomework Homework will consist of problem sets for material covered. Homework will need to be submitted via a GitHub repository named as BIOS524_R_2020_\u0026lt;student last name\u0026gt;. Files should be named, e.g., HW01.Rmd. Homework due date is one week after the lecture. Late homework will NOT be accepted unless permission was given by the instructor. Assignments that are not well organized/documented will receive no credit. Working in small groups is allowed. However, you must do the final writing-up of solutions entirely by yourself. Any two assignments which are word-for-word exactly the same or highly similar in coding style will both receive zero credit. There will be no extra credit projects available.\n Final project  A take-home final project\n Final project should be submitted as a fully reproducible GitHub repository The due date to be determined. Final project page   Grading Policy  Homework: 60% of grade Final Project: 40% of grade  This course will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis. Pass is defined as a grade of at least 70%\n  Copyright Every reasonable effort has been made to protect the copyright requirements of materials used in this course by referring to the original sources.\n Diversity and inclusivity A primary goal of this course is to be inclusive and of value to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.
