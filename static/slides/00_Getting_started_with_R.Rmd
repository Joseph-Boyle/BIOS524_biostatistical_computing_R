## R history

- Elegant, object-oriented programming language.
  - Started by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka (hence `R`) in 1995 as a free, independent, open-source implementation of the `S` programming language
  - Currently, maintained by the R Core development team

- A statistical computing environment with its own language
  - Efficient data analysis
  - Optimized operations on vectors, matrices lists
  - Very sophisticated graphs and data displays

## Bioconductor

"Is an open source and open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data."

**Goals**

- To provide widespread access to a broad range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data
- To provide a common software platform that enables the rapid development and deployment of extensible, scalable, and interoperable software
- To further scientific understanding by producing high-quality documentation and reproducible research
- To train researchers on computational and statistical methods for the analysis of genomic data

## Advantages and disadvantages of `R`

- Free and easy to install

- Highly extensible through packages, collections of functions, data, and documentation

- Active developer community

- Anyone can contribute

- Some learning curve

- No centralized support

- Less consistency in function/variable naming and structure

---
## Install/update R

- Installation for Windows, Mac, and Linux is available

- New version of R is released every 6 month, typically around April/October
    - Bioconductor updates follow shortly thereafter

- Use `installr` R package to cleanly update R on Windows

## Run R

.pull-left[
- Command line. Type `R` and enter the R prompt
    - Type `R CMD` to see the list of available commands
    - Type `Rscript` to see how you can run R commands and scripts from the command line. E.g., `Rscript -e 'print("Hello, world!")'`

- R console, installs with R

- Rcommander. GUI for better interactions with R

## `R` basics - functions

- `R` uses *functions* to do things

- Functions take *arguments* to specify how to do those things

* Example:
```
read.csv(file="scores.csv")
```

`read.csv` is a function to import a CSV file and `file` is an argument that specifies which file to import

---
## `R` basics - running functions

- From the R console - type the function and hit Enter
    - One function at a time, not efficient

- Using an `R` script - a text file that contains all your `R` functions/code
    - `R` scripts allow you to save, edit, reproduce and share your code
    - R scripts stored in files with `.R` extension
    - Run the whole script as `source("script_name.R")`, or, from command line, `Rscript script_name.R`


---
## `R` basics - assignment

- We often need to save a function's result or output. For this we use the assignment operator: ` <- `, preferred over ` = `  
- For example, when you import a CSV file you need to give it a name: 
```
scores <- read.csv(file="scores.csv")
``` 
 
Now we can use `scores` as an argument to other functions. For example, compute summary statistics for each column in the data:

```
summary(scores)
```

.small[**Note**: Use `Alt + -` (Win) or `Option + -` (Mac) in RStudio to quickly insert ` <- `. You can also use `=` for assignment.]

---
## `R` basics - packages

- All functions belong to *packages*. The `read.csv` function is in the `utils` package.

- `R` comes with about 30 packages (called "base `R`"), but as of August 2020 there are over 16,000 CRAN packages and over 1,900 Bioconductor packages

- Example: `ggplot2` is a popular package that adds functions for creating graphs in a different way than what base `R` provides

- To use functions in a package, the package must be installed and loaded. (They're free)
- You only _install_ a package once
- You _load_ a package whenever you want to use its functions

---
## Installing packages

- `install.packages` - installs packages from CRAN, e.g., `install.packages("BiocManager")`

- `remotes` package - installs R packages from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Bioconductor, or plain 'subversion' or 'git' repositories. E.g., `remotes::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")`

- `BiocManager::install()` - Install or update Bioconductor, CRAN, or GitHub packages

- RStudio point-and-click interface

---
## Loading packages

- `library()` will load the package, e.g., `library(readxl)` or `library("readxl")`

- `require()` will load the package, and, if success, return TRUE. Useful in `if` statement, e.g.

```
if (require(ggplot2)) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
```

---
## Useful ways of getting data in and out of R

- Base functions: `read.table`, `read.csv`, `write.table`, `write.csv`

- Tidyverse way, `readr` package: `read_table`, `read_csv`, `read_tsv`, `write_csv` ...

- For fixed-width files, use `read.fwf` or `readr::read_fwf` funcitons

- For reading/writing Excel files, use `readxl` and `writexl` packages, `read_xlsx`, `write_xlsx` functions
    - Remember that `.csv` is the preferred text-based format that opens in Excel

## R is more than a programming language

Numerous packages are available to extend R functionality

- Publication-quality figures, documents in Word, PDF, and HTML formats (Rmarkdown)
    - Templates for journal articles are available

- Presentations, from basic (`ioslides`, `beamer`) to advanced (`xaringan`)

- Web sites for blogs (`blogdown`), books (`bookdown`), packages (`pkgdown`)
    - Templates for CV, resume, thesis are available

- Dynamic web applications using Shiny

- Interface with other programming languages, like C (`Rcpp`), Python (`reticulate`)

- Many more cool usages...
